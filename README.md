# Essential .NET Logging

Guidance, links, utilities, and additional logger providers for .NET `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`

## Using the loggers

### Logger providers

* PS> **dotnet add package [Essential.LoggerProvider.Elasticsearch](src/Essential.LoggerProvider.Elasticsearch)**
* PS> **dotnet add package [Essential.LoggerProvider.RollingFile](src/Essential.LoggerProvider.RollingFile)**
* PS> **dotnet add package [Syslog.StructuredData](https://github.com/sgryphon/syslog-structureddata)**

### Examples

General `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`:

* [Getting Started](examples/GettingStarted)
* [Hello Logging](examples/HelloLogging)

Essential logging `Essential.LoggerProvider`:

* [Hello Rolling File](examples/HelloRollingFile)
* [Hello Elasticsearch](examples/HelloElasticsearch)

### Guidance

* [Theory of Event IDs](docs/Event-Ids.md) 
* [Logging Levels](docs/Logging-Levels.md)

From Microsoft:

* [High performance logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/loggermessage)
* [Logging Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/) -- scroll down to see the built in system categories and the built-in logging providers.


## Development getting started

### Pre-requisites

* .NET Core 3.1 development tools

#### Optional requirements

* PowerShell Core, to run scripts
* An editor, e.g. VS Code, if you want to contribute


### Running unit tests

To test:

```
dotnet test test/Essential.LogTemplate.Tests
```

### Test running examples

Run examples and check the output:

```powershell
dotnet run --project examples/HelloRollingFile
```

### Versioning

Versioning is done automatically with GitVersion, so you can determine the build / package 
number based on the git branch.

### Packaging

The libraries can be easily packaged for release. 

If you do this on a branch, it will have a pre-release version. Once merged to master, it will have the correct GitVersion (including any `+major` or `+minor` version bumps).

```powershell
dotnet pack src/Essential.LogTemplate -c Release --output pack
dotnet pack src/Essential.LoggerProvider.RollingFile -c Release --output pack
```

The results will output to the `pack` folder in the project, with the reference from the LoggerProvider to the LogTemplate automatically converted to a package dependency (with the same version number across both).

#### Testing packages

To turn off the automatic GitVersion numbering, and override with a specific package version (e.g. if you want to update and test package references before release):

```powershell
dotnet pack src/Essential.LogTemplate -p:GetVersion=false -p:PackageVersion=1.0.0 --output pack
dotnet pack src/Essential.LoggerProvider.RollingFile -p:GetVersion=false -p:PackageVersion=1.0.0 --output pack
```

There is a `nuget.config` file in the root of the project that adds the `pack` directory as a source, so that the examples can use it to reference the built packages.

Note that during development you may test multiple builds of the same version, so you need to clear out the NuGet cache (delete from the .nuget/packages folder) and force restore of packages before running:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem (Join-Path $ENV:HOME '.nuget/packages/essential.logging.*') | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
dotnet restore examples/HelloRollingFile --force --no-cache
```


## Other logger provider projects

* Rolling log file, by Andrew Lock

```
dotnet add package NetEscapades.Extensions.Logging.RollingFile
```

Project repository at: https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.Extensions.Logging

* Syslog, by mguinness

```
dotnet add package Syslog.Framework.Logging
```

Project repository at: https://github.com/mguinness/syslog-framework-logging

* Logstash (and Graylog), by Matt Cole  

```
dotnet add package Gelf.Extensions.Logging
```

Project repository at: https://github.com/mattwcole/gelf-extensions-logging

* Seq

https://github.com/datalust/seq-extensions-logging


## Project to-do list / ideas

* add unit tests for rolling file (copy from ED)
* v1.1 of rolling file, with structured data support, facility support (to give full syslog format)
* add readme to LogTemplate project and move template details there
* FormattableString, that allows substring, ellipses, uppercase, lowercase, etc
* rename ColoredConsole to LoggerProvider, and implement (copy from ED initially)
* formats to match existing, e.g. values for Systemd, ScopeLine (with newline at end), MessageLine, ExceptionLine
* Batching for Elasticsearch provider
* Add activity tags / baggage for ES.
* Map ASP.NET path, etc to ECS fields
* Other providers -- database, 

## Jenkins

For local build infrastructure (to test builds), there is a docker compose file in `build/docker` that will create a Jenkins instance and associated docker-in-docker container, to run agents.

Start the docker system:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

You can use Jenkins Blue Ocean to create a pipeline pointing to the Github (or local) repository. There is a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a pipeline to check compilation, run tests (with `-v normal` output), and then run a build script.

The build script, `build.ps1` can also run locally and uses `GitVersion.Tool` to generate version numbers, then package a release version of the components.
